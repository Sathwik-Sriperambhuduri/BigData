#2. From the second text file (file2.txt), write Python code and use MapReduct to count how many times non-English words (names, places, spells etc.) were used. List those words and how many times each was repeated.
There are multiple ways of doing this. You can use pyenchant (https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/), pyspellchecker (https://pyspellchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or just download a list of words (http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) and search through them.

from collections import defaultdict
import re
from spellchecker import SpellChecker

# Initialize the spell checker
spell = SpellChecker()

def map_function(text):
    """ Map function to tokenize text and identify non-English words. """
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', text.lower())  # Tokenize and convert text to lower case
    misspelled = spell.unknown(words)  # Check which words are not recognized as correct English words
    return [(word, 1) for word in misspelled]

def shuffle_sort(mapped_data):
    """ Organize words by key for reduction. """
    shuffled_data = defaultdict(list)
    for key, value in mapped_data:
        shuffled_data[key].append(value)
    return shuffled_data

def reduce_function(shuffled_data):
    """ Reduce function to sum up the occurrences of each non-English word. """
    reduced_data = {}
    for key, values in shuffled_data.items():
        reduced_data[key] = sum(values)
    return reduced_data

def process_file(file_path):
    """ Read the file, and process it through map, shuffle/sort, and reduce phases. """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text = file.read()
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as file:
            text = file.read()

    mapped_data = []
    for line in text.splitlines():
        mapped_data.extend(map_function(line))

    shuffled_data = shuffle_sort(mapped_data)
    reduced_data = reduce_function(shuffled_data)
    
    return reduced_data

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = 'file2.txt'
    non_english_word_counts = process_file(file_path)
    print(non_english_word_counts)
